    <h1>Volumetric Fog Doc</h1>

    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>This is a technical study focusing on Volumetric Fog in stylized UE5 environments, deconstructed from an existing project. The objective is to implement a controllable fog system with adjustable parameters. My goal is to integrate a UI for attribute manipulation; however, the minimum viable product (MVP) will focus on the fundamental creation of the volumetric effect.</p>

    <h2>Fog based on mesh vertex</h2>
    <p>My first attempt used plane-based clouds by animating vertices with noise.</p>

    <p>But since it lacks real volume, the illusion breaks as soon as the camera goes below the horizon—revealing a thin, flat plane instead of dense fog.</p>

    <h2>Volumetric Fog</h2>
    <h3>Volume & Animation</h3>
    <p>I then tried using 3D noise to generate the volume, which worked well for movement and occlusion.</p>
    <p>The issue was that the cloud shapes didn't change as they traveled. By layering two sets of 3D noise with different scales and velocities, I was able to simulate the dynamic, ever-changing nature of real clouds in motion.</p>

    <h3>Shadow</h3>
    <p>I discovered a technique for ground-trailing fog with realistic shadowing. Unfortunately, because the original project was built in UE4 with custom plugins, many of the Blueprint nodes didn't translate directly to UE5. As a result, the shadow implementation remains a challenge for this iteration.</p>
